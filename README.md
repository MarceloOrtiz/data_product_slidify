Im sorry I had trouble trying to publish my slidify presentation. I couldnÂ´t make it work.

You can download de zip folder by clicking on the "download zip" button in Github and extract all the files manually in your computer and you can see the presentation by clicking "index.html" locally. The presentation works well if downloaded locally.

Apologies,
Marcelo
